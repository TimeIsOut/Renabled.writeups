### Solution
The name of the task suggests the idea of using the Vigener cipher. We have been provided with a secret key and an encrypted flag, so we can easily decrypt it. The easiest way to do this is using the service.

### Flag

```
'n00bz{vigenerecipherisfun}'
```

### P.S
The Vigener cipher is a polyalphabetic encryption method based on replacing text characters using a table called the Vigener square. It was developed by the French cryptographer Blaise Vigener in the 16th century.
