So many plane-related challenges! Why not another one? The flag is the latitude, longitude of the place this picture is taken from, rounded upto two decimal places. Example: n00bz{55.51,-20.27}.

### Solution
1) In order to find the flag, you need to look at the metadata of this photo and we can easily find the coordinates:

2) Well, then you can use any service to convert the latitude and longitude to a decimal value:
